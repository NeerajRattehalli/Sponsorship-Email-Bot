# Sponsorship-Email-Bot

A bot that automatically sends emails given a CSV and a template. Input your own CSV file which contains a list of emails along with any other necessary parameters. If it is given a CSV file with multiple multiple contacts from one company, it will send an email only to the first one. Additionally, one must input their own template, which should be based on the CSV file data.
